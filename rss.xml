            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Issues - Bernie Sanders</h1><p>The American people must make a fundamental decision. Do we continue the 40-year decline of our middle class and the growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, or do we fight for a progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/63e3abcccd83198033f0c0955fbcde07d949ee6d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Creating Jobs Rebuilding America - Bernie Sanders</h1><p>Our nation's infrastructure is collapsing, and the American people know it.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>On the Issues: A Fair and Humane Immigration Policy</h1><p>Despite the central role immigrants play in our economy and in our daily lives, undocumented workers are reviled by some for political gain and shunted into the shadows. It is time for this disgraceful situation to end. This country faces enormous problems and they will not be solved unless we are united.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e61387e34679c4a323b6fdf2e93c9aeff84983bc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Reforming Wall Street - Bernie Sanders</h1><p>Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial decisions while expecting the public to bail it out. It is time to break up the largest financial institutions in the country. The six largest financial institutions in this country today hold assets equal to about 60% of the nation's gross domestic product.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bd29e7252652e3538ddf61bd885fc02206e9ed2a.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Strengthen and Expand Social Security - Bernie Sanders</h1><p>Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation's history. Before it was signed into law, nearly half of senior citizens lived in poverty. Today, the elderly poverty rate is 10 percent. Although still much too high, that's a dramatic improvement.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/63e3abcccd83198033f0c0955fbcde07d949ee6d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Fighting for Women's Rights</h1><p>Despite major advances in civil and political rights, our country still has a long way to go in addressing the issue of gender inequality. Many of the achievements that have been made for women's rights in the 20th century have been under attack by the Republican party - denying women control over their own bodies, preventing access to vital medical and social services, and blocking equal pay for equal work.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ea3c1cc98d80763bfa323f664cf1df57c433b02e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
