# Introduction 

On December 18, 2013, we proposed rule and form amendments \[17\] to implement Section 401 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"). \[18\] Section 401 of the JOBS Act amended Section 3(b) of the Securities Act by designating existing Section 3(b) as Section 3(b)(1), and creating new Sections 3(b)(2)-(5). Section 3(b)(2) directs the Commission to adopt rules adding a class of securities exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for offerings of up to $50 million of securities within a 12-month period. Sections 3(b)(2)-(5) specify mandatory terms and conditions for such exempt offerings and also authorize the Commission to adopt other terms, conditions, or requirements as necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors. \[19\] In addition, Section 3(b)(5) directs the Commission to review the $50 million offering limit specified in Section 3(b)(2) not later than two years after the enactment of the JOBS Act and every two years thereafter, and authorizes the Commission to increase the annual offering limit if it determines that it would be appropriate to do so. Accordingly, we are revising Regulation A under the Securities Act to require issuers conducting offerings in reliance on Section 3(b)(2) to comply with terms and conditions established by the Commission's rules, and, where applicable, to make ongoing disclosure.

# Overview

We are adopting final rules to implement the JOBS Act mandate by expanding Regulation A into two tiers: Tier 1, for securities offerings of up to $20 million; and Tier 2, for offerings of up to $50 million. \[20\] The final rules for offerings under Tier 1 and Tier 2 build on current Regulation A and preserve, with some modifications, existing provisions regarding issuer eligibility, offering circular contents, testing the waters, and "bad actor" disqualification. As proposed, and with the modifications described below, the final rules modernize the Regulation A filing process for all offerings, align practice in certain areas with prevailing practice for registered offerings, create additional flexibility for issuers in the offering process, and establish an ongoing reporting regime for Regulation A issuers. Under the final rules, Tier 2 issuers are required to include audited financial statements in their offering documents and to file annual, semiannual, and current reports with the Commission. With the exception of securities that will be listed on a national securities exchange upon qualification, purchasers in Tier 2 offerings must either be accredited investors, as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, or be subject to certain limitations on their investment. The differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings are described more fully below.
In developing the final rules, we considered the statutory language of JOBS Act Section 401, the JOBS Act legislative history, recent recommendations of the Commission's Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation, \[21\] the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies, \[22\] the Equity Capital Formation Task Force, \[23\] comment letters received on Title IV of the JOBS Act before the Commission's proposed rules were issued in December of 2013, \[24\] and comment letters received to date on the Commission's proposed rules to implement Section 401 of the JOBS Act. \[25\]

The key provisions of the final rules and amendments to Regulation A follow: Scope of the exemption---the final rules:

1. Establish two tiers of offerings:
Tier 1: Annual offering limit of $20 million, including no more than $6 million on behalf of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer.
Tier 2: Annual offering limit of $50 million, including no more than $15 million on behalf of selling security holders that are affiliates of the issuer. 
2. Limit sales by selling securityholders in an issuer's initial Regulation A offering and any subsequently qualified Regulation A offering within the first 12-month period following the date of qualification of the initial Regulation A offering to no more than 30% of the aggregate offering price.
Preserve the existing issuer eligibility requirements of Regulation A, and also exclude issuers that are, or have been, subject to any order of the Commission pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act entered within five years before the filing of the offering statement and issuers that are required to, but that have not, filed with the Commission the ongoing reports required by the final rules during the two years immediately preceding the filing of an offering statement.
3. Limit the amount of securities that an investor who is not an accredited investor under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D can purchase in a Tier 2 offering to no more than: (a) 10% of the greater of annual income or net worth (for natural persons); or (b) 10% of the greater of annual revenue or net assets at fiscal year end (for non-natural persons). This limit will not apply to purchases of securities that will be listed on a nationalsecurities exchange upon qualification. 
4. Exclude asset-backed securities, as defined in Regulation AB, from the list of eligible securities.
Update the safe harbor from integration and provide guidance on the potential integration of offerings conducted concurrently with, or close in time after, a Regulation A offering. 

Solicitation materials:

Permit issuers to "test the waters" with, or solicit interest in a potential offering from, the general public either before or after the filing of the offering statement, so long as any solicitation materials used after publicly filing the offering statement are preceded or accompanied by a preliminary offering circular or contain a notice informing potential investors where and how the most current preliminary offering circular can be obtained. 

Qualification, communications, and offering process:

Require issuers and intermediaries in the prequalification period to deliver a preliminary offering circular to prospective purchasers at least 48 hours in advance of sale unless the issuer is subject to, and current in, Tier 2 ongoing reporting obligations. Where the issuer is subject to, and current in, a Tier 2 ongoing reporting obligation, issuers and intermediaries will only be required to comply with the general delivery requirements for offers. 

Modernize the qualification, communications, and offering processes in Regulation A to reflect analogous provisions of the Securities Act registration process: \[26\]

Permit issuers and intermediaries to satisfy their delivery requirements as to the final offering circular under an "access equals delivery" model when sales are made on the basis of offers conducted during the prequalification period and the final offering circular is filed and available on the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (EDGAR);

Require issuers and intermediaries, not later than two business days after completion of a sale, to provide purchasers with a copy of the final offering circular or a notice with the uniform resource locator (URL) where the final offering circular may be obtained on EDGAR and contact information sufficient to notify a purchaser where a request for a final offering circular can be sent and received in response; and
Permit issuers to file offering circular updates and supplements after qualification of the offering statement in lieu of post-qualification amendments in certain circumstances, including to provide the types of information that may be excluded from a prospectus under Rule 430A.

Permit continuous or delayed offerings, but require issuers in continuous or delayed Tier 2 offerings to be current in their annual and semiannual reporting obligations in order to do so.

Permit issuers to qualify additional securities in reliance on Regulation A by filing a post-qualification amendment to a qualified offering statement.

Offering statement: 

Require issuers to file offering statements with the Commission electronically on EDGAR.
Permit the non-public submission of offering statements and amendments for review by Commission staff before filing such documents with the Commission, so long as all such documents are publicly filed not later than 21 calendar days before qualification. 

Eliminate the Model A (Question-and-Answer) disclosure format under Part II of Form 1-A.
Update and clarify Model B (Narrative) disclosure format under Part II of Form 1-A (renamed, "Offering Circular"), while continuing to permit Part I of Form S-1 narrative disclosure as an alternative.
Permit real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similarly eligible companies to provide the narrative disclosure required by Part I of Form S-11 in Part II of Form 1-A. 

Require that offering statements be qualified by the Commission before sales may be made pursuant to Regulation A.

Require Tier 1 and Tier 2 issuers to file balance sheets and related financial statements for the two previous fiscal year ends (or for such shorter time that they have been in existence).

Require Tier 2 issuers to include financial statements in their offering circulars that are audited in accordance with either the auditing standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) (referred to as U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards or GAAS) or the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). 

Require Tier 1 and Tier 2 issuers to include financial statements in Form 1-A that are dated not more than nine months before the date of non-public submission, filing, or qualification, with the most recent annual or interim balance sheet not older than nine months. If interim financial statements are required, they must cover a period of at least six months. 

Ongoing reporting: 

Require Tier 1 issuers to provide information about sales in such offerings and to update certain issuer information by electronically filing a Form 1-Z exit report with the Commission not later than 30 calendar days after termination or completion of an offering. 

Require Tier 2 issuers to file electronically with the Commission on EDGAR annual and semiannual reports, as well as current event reports.
Require Tier 2 issuers to file electronically a special financial report to cover financial periods between the most recent period included in a qualified offering statement and the issuer's first required periodic report.
Permit the ongoing reports filed by an issuer conducting a Tier 2 offering to satisfy a broker-dealer's obligations under Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11\. 

Provide that Tier 2 issuers' reporting obligations under Regulation A would suspend when they are subject to the ongoing reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and may also be suspended under Regulation A at any time by filing a Form 1-Z exit report after completing reporting for the fiscal year in which an offering statement was qualified, so long as the securities of each class to which the offering statement relates are held of record by fewer than 300 persons, or fewer than 1,200 persons for banks or bank holding companies, and offers or sales made in reliance on a qualified Tier 2 Regulation A offering statement are not ongoing. 

In certain circumstances, Tier 2 Regulation A reporting obligations may terminate when issuers are no longer subject to the ongoing reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act.
Require Tier 2 issuers to include in their first annual report after termination or completion of a qualified Regulation A offering, or in their Form 1-Z exit report, information about sales in the terminated or completed offering and to update certain issuer information.
Eliminate the requirement that issuers file a Form 2-A with the Commissionto report sales and the termination of sales made under Regulation A every six months after qualification and within 30 calendar days after the termination, completion, or final sale of securities in the offering.
Exchange Act registration:
Conditionally exempt securities issued in a Tier 2 offering from the mandatory registration requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, for so long as the issuer engages the services of a transfer agent that is registered with the Commission under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, remains subject to a Tier 2 reporting obligation, is current in its annual and semiannual reporting at fiscal year end, and had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed semiannual period, or, in the absence of a public float, had annual revenues of less than $50 million as of its most recently completed fiscal year.
Permit Tier 2 issuers to use a Form 8-A short form registration statement concurrently with the qualification of a Regulation A offering statement that includes Part I of Form S-1 or Form S-11 narrative disclosure in Form 1-A in order to register a class of securities under Sections 12(g) or 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
"Bad actor" disqualification provisions:
Substantially conform the "bad actor" disqualification provisions of Rule 262 to Rule 506(d) and add a disclosure requirement similar to Rule 506(e).
Application of state securities laws:
Provide for the preemption of state securities law registration and qualification requirements for securities offered or sold to "qualified purchasers," in light of the total package of investor protections included in the final rules. A qualified purchaser will be defined to be any person to whom securities are offered or sold in a Tier 2 offering.
The Commission is required by Section 3(b)(5) of the Securities Act to review the Tier 2 offering limitation every two years. In addition to revisiting the Tier 2 offering limitation, the staff will also undertake to review the Tier 1 offering limitation at the same time. The staff also will undertake to study and submit a report to the Commission no later than 5 years following the adoption of the amendments to Regulation A, on the impact of both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings on capital formation and investor protection. The report will include, but not be limited to, a review of: (1) The amount of capital raised under the amendments; (2) the number of issuances and amount raised by both Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings; (3) the number of placement agents and brokers facilitating the Regulation A offerings; (4) the number of Federal, State, or any other actions taken against issuers, placement agents, or brokers with respect to both Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings; and (5) whether any additional investor protections are necessary for either Tier 1 or Tier 2\. Based on the information contained in the report, the Commission may propose to either decrease or increase the offering limit for Tier 1, as appropriate.
