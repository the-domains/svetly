# Energy

It's no secret America is addicted to Oil, most of which we import from our enemies. What's not as well known is there are powerful monopolistic forces keeping it that way.

Solution: [Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011][0]

Simply says all cars built or sold in america will have the Flex Fuel ability. 

Status: introduced into committee every session since 2006\. Hasn't left a committee for a vote. 

Reason: Members of the committee's get campaign contributions from Big Oil.

* United States House Committee on Energy & Commerce 
* United States House Committee on Ways & Means 
* United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation 

The United States government is not just helping by not passing laws, but also instituting regulations that keep the monopoly in control. Today, illegal for commercial operations to install flex fuel kits and pouring anything in your car not specifically designated by the manufacturer is technically illegal, and re programming your car to accept other fuels, etc. is also illegal.

How do we fix this?
